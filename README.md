# US-Patent-Distribution-Map

# U.S. Patent Distribution Map (2014)

This project visualizes the distribution of patents across U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the year 2014. The visualization is presented as an interactive choropleth map created using **Flourish** and published with **GitHub Pages**.


## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Identify regions in the U.S. with high patent activity.  
- **Data Source:** [USPTO – Patents by MSA](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/cls_cbsa/allcbsa_gd.htm)  
- **Visualization Tool:** Flourish (embedded in HTML).  
- **Techniques:** Choropleth mapping with labeled top 5 MSAs by patent count.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Top 5 MSAs account for ~33% of all patents in 2014.  
- 22 MSAs had fewer than 10 patents, showing uneven distribution.  
- Innovation hubs correlate with universities, research institutions, and venture capital ecosystems.  
- Regions with low patent activity may lack infrastructure or funding.
