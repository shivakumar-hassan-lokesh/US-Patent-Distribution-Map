# U.S. Patent Distribution Map (2014)

This project presents an analysis of U.S. patent activity in 2014, mapped across Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs).  
The interactive choropleth highlights where innovation is most concentrated, revealing major technology hubs like Silicon Valley, Boston, and New York, alongside regions with relatively low patent generation.  
By combining geographic visualization with patent data, the project offers a clear view of the uneven distribution of innovation across the country.



## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Identify regions in the U.S. with high patent activity.  
- **Data Source:** [USPTO â€“ Patents by MSA](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/cls_cbsa/allcbsa_gd.htm)  
- **Visualization Tool:** Flourish (embedded in HTML).  
- **Techniques:** Choropleth mapping with labeled top 5 MSAs by patent count.

## Key Insights
- Top 5 MSAs account for ~33% of all patents in 2014.  
- 22 MSAs had fewer than 10 patents, showing uneven distribution.  
- Innovation hubs correlate with universities, research institutions, and venture capital ecosystems.  
- Regions with low patent activity may lack infrastructure or funding.
